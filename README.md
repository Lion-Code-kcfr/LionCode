Langston University Lion Code – Don’t Make Me Think

Time sheet discrepancies are common in the work place.  Many employees have their colleagues clock them in when they are late to work and take longer breaks than allowed.  An additional issue in the workplace is workers forgetting to clock-out at the end of the work day. Our solution “SEC” clocks you in and out in a sec.  
SEC requires no thought from employees or managers.  Work hours are guaranteed to match employee’s hours.  No more forgetting to clock-in or clock-out.  SEC automatically does it for you.  It will send a notification to your phone letting you know when you clock in and out. It reduces the time many managers spend correcting timesheets.  Best of all it “doesn’t make the employee or manager think” while accomplishing all of this.
